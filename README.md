# Intelligent API Usage Governance Platform

A cloud-native backend system designed to monitor, analyze, and intelligently govern API usage beyond traditional static rate limiting.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional API rate limiting uses fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to real-world usage patterns, leading to either blocked legitimate traffic or unnoticed abuse.

## 🎯 Solution
This platform introduces a behavior-aware governance layer that dynamically regulates API traffic based on real-time usage metrics, consumer profiles, and governance policies.

## 🧱 Core Features
- Adaptive rate limiting
- API usage monitoring
- Policy-based traffic control
- Consumer profiling
- Cloud-native deployment readiness

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Node.js (ES6+)
- Express.js
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- AWS (API Gateway, ECS, CloudWatch)
- Prometheus & Grafana
